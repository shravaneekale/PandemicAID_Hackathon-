                <div class="faq_answer" >The COVID-19 vaccines available in Australia are very effective. Clinical trials and real world evidence have found that the vaccines are 70% to 95% effective in preventing people from getting sick with COVID-19. This means that people who are fully vaccinated are 70% to 95% less likely to get sick with COVID-19 compared with those who are not vaccinated, if they are exposed to the virus. However, a small proportion of fully vaccinated people may still get the disease. This does not mean the vaccines are not working. There are no vaccines, for any disease, that are 100% effective.
